Final Project Summary

Disclaimer and Data Transparency
This project is a portfolio piece created to demonstrate data science skills. It does not use TikTok's internal data and is not affiliated with the company.
The scenario was developed based on publicly available information about the digital music landscape and challenges social media platforms face regarding music licensing. The data was synthesized to create a realistic, fictional case study.
The framework used in this project, from causal inference to actionable recommendations, is designed to showcase skills sought by Big Data teams and demonstrate the ability to translate a business problem into a complete, data-driven solution.


Business Problem: The new TikTok music policy for livestreams has significantly impacted a key creator group (DJs), risking their migration to other platforms and a decline in music-related content and engagement.


Solution: A causal inference study using the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method was performed to quantify the policy's effect. The analysis revealed a statistically significant negative impact on key metrics for affected DJs.


Key Findings:


View Duration: A causal effect of approximately -15 minutes on average livestream view duration.


Viewers: A causal effect of approximately -2,956 on average total viewers per livestream.

These findings confirm the policy change is directly causing a sharp decline in audience engagement.

Recommendations:


Launch a DJ Creator Program to provide a licensed music library, addressing the policy restrictions and enabling creative expression.


Develop an AI tool to assist DJs in creating policy-compliant "Original Sounds".


Implement new KPIs to monitor the success of these retention efforts and ensure the long-term health of TikTok's music ecosystem.
