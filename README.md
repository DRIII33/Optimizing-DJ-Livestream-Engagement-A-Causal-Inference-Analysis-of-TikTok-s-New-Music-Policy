Optimizing DJ Livestream Engagement: A Causal Inference Analysis of TikTok's New Music Policy

Project Goal
This project aims to evaluate the causal impact of TikTok's new Music Terms of Service, which restrict the use of copyrighted music in livestreams, on DJ livestream engagement. The ultimate objective is to develop data-driven recommendations to help retain DJs and maintain a vibrant music ecosystem on the platform.

Key Success Metrics
Primary KPI: Average livestream view duration (minutes).

Secondary Metrics:

Total unique viewers per livestream.

Number of livestreams per DJ per month.

Share of "Original Sounds" vs. licensed music in DJ livestreams.

Hypotheses
H1: The new music policy change has a negative causal effect on the average livestream view duration for DJs who previously relied on copyrighted music.

H2: The policy change leads to a decrease in the number of livestreams broadcasted by affected DJs.

H3: DJs affected by the policy are more likely to migrate to other platforms or reduce their activity on TikTok.
